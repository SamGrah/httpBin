## Description
This is a simple tool for capturing and reviewing requests made by a webhook.
The user creates a 'bin' and the app provides two unique endpoints to the user.

All requests made to one of the unique endpoints will be captured in a MongoDB instance.
The other unique endpoint provides a page on which the user can review all of those captured requests.

It's main use is to test that webhooks are configured and working as expected.
